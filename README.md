# WorldQuant-University-Data-Science-projects

I have successfully completed a 16-week and 8 end-to-end, applied data science projects of the Applied Data Science Lab module at WorldQuant University. The mini-projects included scientific computing, data wrangling, machine learning and natural language processing with Python.

1. Housing in Mexico:
Explore the impact of property size versus location on real estate prices.
Utilize pandas DataFrame for data loading and cleaning.
Create insightful visualizations to examine the relationship between variables.

2. Apartment Sales in Buenos Aires:
Build a linear regression model to predict apartment prices in Argentina.
Implement a machine learning pipeline with feature encoding and imputation.
Visualize model coefficients and insights using Mapbox scatter plots and heatmaps.

3. Air Quality in Nairobi:
Develop an ARMA time-series model to predict particulate matter levels in Kenya.
Retrieve data from a MongoDB database and perform time series data exploration.
Tune hyperparameters for improved model performance.

4. Earthquake Damage in Nepal:
Construct logistic regression and decision tree models to predict earthquake damage to buildings.
Extract data from a SQL database and perform model evaluation through train-test splits.
Fine-tune model hyperparameters for enhanced predictive accuracy.

5. Bankruptcy in Poland:
Build random forest and gradient boosting models to predict company bankruptcy.
Handle imbalanced data using resampling techniques.
Evaluate model performance using precision and recall metrics.

6. Customer Segmentation in the US:
Employ k-means clustering to segment US consumers into distinct groups.
Conduct exploratory data analysis and feature selection for clustering.
Deploy a Dash web application for interactive visualization.

7. A/B Testing at WorldQuant University:
Conduct chi-square tests to assess the impact of email campaigns on program enrollment.
Design experiments and analyze results using statistical methods.
Build an interactive web application for data visualization and analysis.

8. Volatility Forecasting in India:
Create a GARCH time series model to predict asset volatility.
Retrieve data from web APIs and load it into a SQL database.
Build a custom web API to serve model predictions.
